# Docker Troubleshooting

Common Docker connectivity issues and their solutions for running the Nextra documentation starter.

## Common Error: Docker Pipe Connection Failed

### Error Message
```bash
unable to get image 'nextra-docs-starter-plus-nextra-dev': error during connect: Get "http://%2F%2F.%2Fpipe%2FdockerDesktopLinuxEngine/v1.47/images/nextra-docs-starter-plus-nextra-dev/json": open //./pipe/dockerDesktopLinuxEngine: The system cannot find the file specified.
```

### Root Causes
This error typically occurs when:
- Docker Desktop is not running or not fully started
- Missing Windows features (Containers, Hyper-V)
- WSL2 vs Hyper-V backend conflicts
- BitLocker/FVE registry policy blocking containers
- Docker Engine service not running

## Quick Solutions

### Solution 1: Start Docker Desktop First!

**This fixes 90% of cases** - The most common mistake is running Docker commands before Docker Desktop is started.

```bash
# ❌ Wrong: Running commands before Docker Desktop is ready
npm run docker:dev

# ✅ Correct: Always start Docker Desktop first
# 1. Search "Docker Desktop" in Start menu and launch it
# 2. WAIT for it to fully load (whale icon stops spinning)
# 3. Look for "Docker Desktop is running" message
# 4. THEN run your commands:
npm run docker:dev
```

**How to verify Docker Desktop is ready:**
- Right-click Docker system tray icon → Should show "Docker Desktop is running"
- The whale icon should not be spinning/loading
- Docker Desktop window shows green "running" status

### Solution 2: Enable Windows Features

Missing Windows features are the second most common cause.

**Using PowerShell (Recommended - Run as Administrator):**
```powershell
# Enable required Windows features
Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName $("Microsoft-Hyper-V", "Containers") -All

# Restart your computer after this command
```

**Using Windows Features GUI:**
1. Press `Win + R` → type `appwiz.cpl` → Enter
2. Click "Turn Windows features on or off"
3. Enable these features:
   - ✅ **Containers**
   - ✅ **Hyper-V** (if available)
   - ✅ **Windows Subsystem for Linux**
   - ✅ **Virtual Machine Platform**
4. Click OK and **restart your computer**

**Verify installation after restart:**
```bash
# Check Docker installation
docker --version
docker compose version
docker info
```

### Solution 3: Fix BitLocker Registry Policy

This registry fix has solved many persistent issues.

**Run as Administrator in PowerShell:**
```powershell
# Check if the problematic registry key exists
Get-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Policies\Microsoft\FVE" -Name "FDVDenyWriteAccess" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

# If it exists and is set to 1, change it to 0
Set-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Policies\Microsoft\FVE" -Name "FDVDenyWriteAccess" -Value 0

# Restart Docker Desktop after this change
```

### Solution 4: Switch Docker Backend

Try switching between WSL2 and Hyper-V backends.

**In Docker Desktop Settings:**
1. Right-click Docker icon → Settings
2. Go to "General"
3. Toggle "Use WSL 2 instead of Hyper-V":
   - If checked → Uncheck it (use Hyper-V)
   - If unchecked → Check it (use WSL2)
4. Apply & Restart Docker Desktop

**If using WSL2, verify integration:**
- Go to "Resources" → "WSL Integration"
- Ensure integration is enabled for your WSL distro

**Restart WSL if needed:**
```bash
# In PowerShell as Administrator
wsl --shutdown
wsl
```

## Advanced Troubleshooting

### Check Windows Services

Verify Docker services are running properly.

**Using PowerShell (Run as Administrator):**
```powershell
# Check Docker service status
Get-Service | Where-Object {$_.Name -like "*docker*"}

# Start Docker services if needed
Start-Service "Docker Desktop Service"

# Restart all Docker services
Restart-Service "Docker Desktop Service"
```

**Check Named Pipes:**
```powershell
# List Docker-related pipes
[System.IO.Directory]::GetFiles("\\.\pipe\") | Select-String docker

# Should see pipes like:
# \\.\pipe\docker_engine
# \\.\pipe\dockerDesktopLinuxEngine
```

### Test Docker Connectivity

Run these commands to verify Docker is working:

```bash
# Simple connectivity test
docker run hello-world

# List containers
docker ps -a

# Check Docker system info
docker system info
```

## Package Manager Issues

### Error: "npm ci can only install with existing package-lock.json"

This project uses **pnpm** but the Dockerfile tries to run **npm ci**.

**Solution A: Update Dockerfile to use pnpm (Recommended)**
```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine AS base
RUN npm install -g pnpm
WORKDIR /app

FROM base AS deps
COPY package.json pnpm-lock.yaml ./
RUN pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
```

**Solution B: Generate package-lock.json**
```bash
# Remove pnpm lockfile and use npm
rm pnpm-lock.yaml
npm install
# This creates package-lock.json for Docker
```

### Error: "Lockfile not compatible with current pnpm"

Version mismatch between local pnpm and Docker container.

**Solution: Pin pnpm version in Dockerfile**
```dockerfile
# Install specific pnpm version
RUN npm install -g pnpm@8  # Use version compatible with your lockfile
```

## Environment-Specific Issues

### Windows-Specific Fixes

**Hyper-V Conflicts:**
If you have VirtualBox or other virtualization software:
```bash
# Disable Hyper-V (requires restart)
bcdedit /set hypervisorlaunchtype off

# Re-enable Hyper-V (requires restart)
bcdedit /set hypervisorlaunchtype auto
```

**Required Windows Features:**
- Windows Subsystem for Linux
- Virtual Machine Platform
- Hyper-V (Windows Pro/Enterprise only)
- Containers

### Hot Reload Issues

If hot reload isn't working in development:

1. Verify environment variables in `docker-compose.dev.yml`:
   ```yaml
   environment:
     - WATCHPACK_POLLING=true
     - CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING=true
   ```

2. Check volume mounting configuration
3. Ensure Docker has access to project directory
4. Restart Docker Desktop if necessary

### Port Conflicts

If port 3000 is already in use:

```yaml
# In docker-compose.dev.yml
ports:
  - "3001:3000"  # Use alternative port
```

## Verification Steps

After applying fixes, test your setup:

```bash
# Test Docker basic functionality
docker run --rm alpine echo "Docker is working!"

# Test Docker Compose
docker compose --help

# Test development environment
npm run docker:dev
```

**Expected success output:**
```bash
[+] Building 0.5s (12/12) FINISHED
[+] Running 1/1
 ✔ Container nextra-docs-dev  Created
 ✔ Container nextra-docs-dev  Started

nextra-docs-dev  | Ready - started server on 0.0.0.0:3000
```

## Emergency Fixes

### Complete Docker Reset

If nothing else works, try a complete reset:

1. **Close Docker Desktop completely**
2. **End all Docker processes in Task Manager**
3. **Reset Docker Desktop:**
   - Docker Desktop Settings → "Troubleshoot" → "Reset to factory defaults"
   - ⚠️ **Warning:** This removes all containers and images

### Reinstall Docker Desktop

As a last resort:
1. Uninstall Docker Desktop completely
2. Download latest version from [docker.com](https://docker.com)
3. Install fresh copy
4. Enable required Windows features
5. Configure backend (WSL2 vs Hyper-V)

## Getting Additional Help

If you're still experiencing issues:

1. **Check Docker Desktop logs:**
   - Docker Desktop → Troubleshoot → View logs

2. **Run Docker Desktop diagnostics:**
   - Docker Desktop → Troubleshoot → Run diagnostics

3. **Community resources:**

## Success Stories

These exact solutions have worked for real users:

> **"Just Start Docker Desktop First"** - The most common fix
> "I figured out my problem. I didn't run docker desktop first… running docker desktop created the VM and all is well" - Docker Forums

> **"Enable Windows Features"** - Second most common fix
> `Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName $("Microsoft-Hyper-V", "Containers") -All` solved it

> **"BitLocker Registry Fix"** - For persistent issues
